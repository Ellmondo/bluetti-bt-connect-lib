# bluetti-bt-connect-lib

> **This is a fork** of [bluetti-bt-lib](https://github.com/Patrick762/bluetti-bt-lib) by [Patrick762](https://github.com/Patrick762), extended with additional device support, register corrections, and new writable fields for the Bluetti EP2000. All credit for the original protocol reverse-engineering, architecture, and core library design goes to Patrick762 and the project's other contributors. This fork exists to track device-specific fixes and additions on a faster iteration cycle; where possible, improvements are intended to be contributed back upstream.

## ✅ EP2000: full local write control (v2.0)

Earlier versions of this fork carried a long warning that grid and working-mode
writes were accepted by the device and then silently reverted, and speculated it
was a cloud/authentication or "Pro Mode" gate. **That is solved as of v2.0**, and
the cause turned out to be mundane: this is a 2nd-generation IoT device whose
authoritative settings controller sits on **Modbus slave 0**, while the inverter
answers on **slave 1**. The fork was writing to slave 1 - the inverter echoed the
write and then overwrote it within a few seconds from the slave-0 setpoint.
Writing to slave 0 makes the change persist. This matches the official Bluetti
app, which sends settings to slave 0 on this device class; the few-second delay
you may notice before a change shows up is the value propagating back to the
slave-1 reading (the same delay the app shows before it opens its settings
screen).

**What this means on the EP2000 now:**

- **Grid export power/current, grid import power/current, working mode, AC
  output, charge-from-grid and grid-export enables all write and persist** over
  local BLE. Give a write a few seconds to settle before trusting the read-back.
- A new **AI Control Mode** switch exposes register 2241. When Bluetti's AI/EMS
  is on it actively manages the system and will override your manual settings
  (the old "accept-then-revert" you would then see). Leave it **off** for manual
  control; the switch lets you see and change that state from Home Assistant.

**Still worth knowing:**

- **Grid export and grid-protection parameters are regulated for interconnection
  safety in most jurisdictions** (anti-islanding, voltage/frequency ride-through).
  Whether or not a write persists, changing them may carry real compliance
  implications depending on where you live and how your system is connected.
- Reliability can still vary by firmware version and by unit. This is confirmed
  on an EP2000 + EBOX; if a control misbehaves on your setup, the standalone BLE
  diagnostics below will show you exactly what the device is doing.

Full technical detail - the investigation and the register-level evidence - is in
the v2.0 release notes (`RELEASE_NOTES_2.0.0.md`).

### Read device data for supported devices

```bash
usage: bluetti-read [-h] [-m MAC] [-t TYPE] [-e ENCRYPTION]

Detect bluetti devices

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m MAC, --mac MAC     Mac-address of the powerstation
  -t TYPE, --type TYPE  Type of the powerstation (AC70 f.ex.)
  -e ENCRYPTION, --encryption ENCRYPTION
                        Add this if encryption is needed
```

Example:

```bash
bluetti-read -m 00:00:00:00:00:00 -t EB3A
```

Example output:
```bash
FieldName.DEVICE_TYPE: EB3A
FieldName.DEVICE_SN: 0000000000000
FieldName.BATTERY_SOC: 92%
FieldName.DC_INPUT_POWER: 0W
FieldName.AC_INPUT_POWER: 0W
FieldName.AC_OUTPUT_POWER: 0W
FieldName.DC_OUTPUT_POWER: 0W
FieldName.CTRL_AC: False
FieldName.CTRL_DC: True
FieldName.CTRL_LED_MODE: LedMode.OFF
FieldName.CTRL_POWER_OFF: False
FieldName.CTRL_ECO: False
FieldName.CTRL_ECO_TIME_MODE: EcoMode.HOURS1
FieldName.CTRL_CHARGING_MODE: ChargingMode.STANDARD
FieldName.CTRL_POWER_LIFTING: False
```

### Write to supported device

INFO: Devices with encryption are currently not supported!

```bash
usage: bluetti-write [-h] [-m MAC] [-t TYPE] [--on ON] [--off OFF] [-v VALUE] [-e ENCRYPTION] field

Write to bluetti device

positional arguments:
  field                 Field name (ctrl_dc f.ex.)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m MAC, --mac MAC     Mac-address of the powerstation
  -t TYPE, --type TYPE  Type of the powerstation (AC70 f.ex.)
  --on ON               Value to write
  --off OFF             Value to write
  -v VALUE, --value VALUE
                        Value to write (integer, see enum for value)
  -e ENCRYPTION, --encryption ENCRYPTION
                        Add this if encryption is needed
```

Example:

```bash
bluetti-write -m 00:00:00:00:00:00 -t EB3A --on on ctrl_ac
```

## Standalone BLE diagnostics (repo scripts)

These live at the repo root and are self-contained (raw Modbus over the GATT
write characteristic - no library import needed). They were written while
diagnosing the slave-0 write behaviour and are kept for future debugging. Run
them from a venv that has `bleak`, `bleak-retry-connector` and `crcmod`
installed, with the device free (turn off any "Hold Bluetooth connection" switch
in Home Assistant first so the station is not already connected).

- `scan_addr.py` - list nearby BLE devices and their addresses (on macOS the
  address is a CoreBluetooth UUID).
- `probe_grid.py` - dump the grid import/export registers at both slaves, sweep
  nearby, and optionally test that an import write persists (`--test-import N`).
- `probe_slave.py` - A/B a write at slave 0 vs slave 1 with read-back (this is
  the one that pinned down the fix).
- `probe_writepath.py` - test write strategies (EMS on/off, slave, commit pulse).
- `probe_commit.py` - write a value, then watch it for ~45s to catch a slow
  revert and test commit pulses.

```bash
python probe_grid.py --mac <address>
python probe_slave.py --mac <address> --reg 2215 --value 1500
```

Get `<address>` from `scan_addr.py` or `bluetti-scan`.

## Adding fields

To add new fields, you can use the `bluetti-detect` command to first find out which version of iot protocol is used and if it uses encryption.

After you got this information, you can use the `bluetti-readall` command to read every registry and save the data to a json file. You should also note all values you see in the app to later compare the data.

Here's how to use the `bluetti-readall` command:

```bash
usage: bluetti-readall [-h] [-m MAC] [-v VERSION] [-e ENCRYPTION]

Detect bluetti devices

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m MAC, --mac MAC     Mac-address of the powerstation
  -v VERSION, --version VERSION
                        IoT protocol version
  -e ENCRYPTION, --encryption ENCRYPTION
                        Add this if encryption is needed
```

With the separate tool at [bluetti-bt-raw-reader](https://github.com/Patrick762/bluetti-bt-raw-reader) you can view those values in a more understandable way.

You can also share the output with me using [this form](https://forms.gle/ewp7DYigtaN3ZLc68)


To test added fields with the created json file, use `bluetti-parse`:

```bash
usage: bluetti-parse [-h] file

Parse readall output files

positional arguments:
  file        JSON file of the powerstation readall output

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```
