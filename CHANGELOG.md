# Changelog: bluetti-bt-connect-lib

Newest first. Each section is also published as the GitHub release for that version.

## 2.0.8 (2026-10-05)

### Fixed: EP2000 active cell count

`active_cell_count` read register 6153, which holds the pack's number of
temperature sensors (NTCs), not cells. On a seven-B700 HV800 stack it showed
112 instead of 224. BLUETTI's app reads three counts side by side:

| register (low byte) | count | example |
|---|---|---|
| 6152 | cells | 224 |
| 6153 | temperature sensors (NTCs) | 112 |
| 6154 | battery modules (BMUs, one per B700) | 7 |

`active_cell_count` now reads 6152. A new `temperature_sensor_count` field
reads 6153. `battery_stack_count` (6154) is unchanged and is the
battery-module count. All three are read in one request.

## 2.0.7 (2026-10-05)

Everything in this release was decoded the way BLUETTI's own app decodes it,
and checked against a real EP2000 + EBOX + HV800. All new fields are
read-only.

### EP2000

**Working mode 11.** `WorkingMode.SELF_CONSUMPTION_EXPORT` (self-consumption
with export) is now known. BLUETTI's app offers it only on the EP2000 and
EP19K. Before this, the working mode read as unknown whenever it was set.

**From the inverter (slave 1)**

| field | register | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ems_control_mode` | 2241, low nibble | `EmsControlMode`: LOCAL 0, CLOUD 3, LOCAL_SELECTED 4, DYNAMIC_PRICING 5, VPP 7, AI 8. `CLOUD_CONTROLLED_EMS_MODES` lists 3/5/7 |
| `firmware_arm`, `firmware_dsp` | software list at 1112 | e.g. "5032.22" |

**From the EBOX (slave 0)**

| field | register | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `battery_status` | 103 | `BatteryStatus`: IDLE, CHARGING, DISCHARGING |
| `time_remaining_minutes` | 104 | minutes to full or to empty (the EBOX reports one value in both registers) |
| `active_alarms` | 122–138 | active warnings and faults as text, e.g. "B104 PV2 Voltage Low", or "None" |
| `alarm_count` | 122–138 | number of active warnings and faults |
| `inverter_status` | 161 | `InverterStatus`: OFF, OFF_GRID, GRID_BYPASS, GRID_CONNECTED, GRID_CONNECTED_CHARGING, GRID_CONNECTED_DISCHARGING, ERROR, OFF_GRID_ABNORMAL |
| `system_error` | 174, bits 5/6/7/10 | IoT, BMS, other or meter error flag |
| `ac_pv_power`, `ac_pv_l1/l2/l3_power`, `ac_pv_l1/l2/l3_voltage` | PV slots 3–5 (1226, 1234, 1242) | AC-coupled PV (for example Enphase) through the AC PV meter. Only reported for slots of type 101; 0 W without a meter |
| `time_control_enabled` | 2029 | the schedule used by Custom mode |
| `schedule_slot_1` … `_6` | 2030 + 3n | e.g. "Charge 11:01-13:59", "Discharge 18:00-21:00", "Off" |
| `max_charge_current`, `max_discharge_current` | 6011, 6012 | BMS limits, A |
| `firmware_iot` | 11014 | e.g. "9052.26" |
| `cloud_connected` | 11018, bit 6 | the EBOX's MQTT link to BLUETTI's cloud |
| `wifi_signal` | 11026 | dBm (low byte − 256) |

Alarm texts come from the app's own tables. Table B is used for high-power
inverters (register 122 = 3) and table E otherwise; see
`fields/alarm_codes.py`. A bit with no table entry is shown as `R<register>.<bit>`.

### New field types

`MaskedEnumField`, `BitMaskField`, `LowByteOffsetField`,
`FirmwareVersionField`, `U32VersionField`, `ScheduleSlotField`,
`AlarmListField` / `AlarmCountField`, `AcPvSlotField` / `AcPvTotalField`.

### Polling

The EP2000 poll grows from 20 to 28 requests. The eight new ones go to the
EBOX and cover only ranges a real unit was confirmed to serve.

## 2.0.6 (2026-10-05)

### Fixed: EP2000 pack temperature is °C + 40, not °F

`pack_temperature` (6115) is now decoded as **raw − 40, in °C**. This is
how BLUETTI's own app decodes it: the pack item block's average temperature,
and the same for 6007, the cell NTCs and the inverter's temperatures. 2.0.4
read it as °F based on a fit against air temperature, and the vendor decoding
replaces that. A raw 66 now reads 26 °C, where 2.0.4 showed 18.9 °C.

New field type `OffsetIntField` (raw + a fixed offset) carries it.

### New: fields read from another slave

A field can now be read from a slave other than 1 with `.at_slave(n)`:

```python
SInt32Field(FieldName.HOME_LOAD_POWER, 142).at_slave(0)
```

Reads are grouped per slave and never mixed in one request. A response is
only matched against fields of the slave that answered, so the same address
can be read from two slaves side by side. `ReadableRegisters.slave` and
`BluettiDevice.parse(..., slave=)` carry it through. With `raw=True`, results
from a slave other than 1 are keyed `(slave, address)`.

### New: EP2000 home data from the EBOX (slave 0)

The inverter (slave 1) leaves most of the home data block at 0. The EBOX
(slave 0) fills it in. Read from there, all in one request (142, 23
registers):

| field | register | unit |
|---|---|---|
| `home_load_power` | 142 (s32) | W |
| `home_consumption_energy` | 152 (u32 ×0.1) | kWh |
| `solar_energy` | 154 (u32 ×0.1) | kWh |
| `grid_import_energy` | 156 (u32 ×0.1) | kWh |
| `grid_export_energy` | 158 (u32 ×0.1) | kWh |
| `self_sufficiency` | 164 | % |

The layout comes from BLUETTI's app. The energy totals were checked against
the app's lifetime statistics on a real system. They are 32-bit, low word
first, so they keep counting past 6553.5 kWh.

This also brings back the consumption and grid feed-in totals that 2.0.5
removed: they were 0 because they were being read from the inverter.

## 2.0.5 (2026-10-05)

### EP2000

Removed three energy totals that never reported anything on the EP2000:

| field | register |
|---|---|
| `total_ac_consumption` | 152 |
| `total_grid_feed` | 158 |
| `power_generation` | 1202 |

All three read a flat 0 through more than a week of normal running,
including days of solar generation, in Home Assistant history and in direct
register reads. They aren't scaled or offset wrongly. The registers simply
don't hold those totals on this model.

`total_ac_consumption` and `total_grid_feed` were only used by the EP2000,
so their names are gone from `FieldName`. `power_generation` stays, because
the AC2A, AC2P, EP600 and AC300 still read it from their own registers.

For kWh totals, use Home Assistant's Integral helper on the power sensors,
such as Total PV Power for solar generation.

## 2.0.4 (2026-10-04)

### EP2000

- **Pack temperature** (`pack_temperature`, register 6115). Reported in
  **°F**, exactly as the device sends it, with the unit declared so Home
  Assistant converts it to each user's own unit. Signed.

  The unit was settled in bluetti-community/bluetti-registers#42. Over an
  idle day the raw value tracked a nearby air sensor at about 1.7 per °C and
  stayed a few degrees below it in shade. That fits °F; °C + 40 would have
  needed the idle pack to run warmer than the air. It also matches a Modbus
  TCP reading against a thermal camera on another EP2000, and BLUETTI's
  documented -40..160 range. 6115 now rides in the normal grouped pack read.

- **Connected devices** (`connected_devices`), counted from the battery's
  own node list at 21002. It replaces `total_node_count` (21001), which was
  always 0 and was never a count. The count reads four entries, so a system
  with more than four devices reports four.

- **Removed:** the raw probe registers 6007 and 6115 from 2.0.2. 6115 became
  the pack temperature; 6007 holds the same value on a single-pack system.

### Node list

`parse_node_list()` and `Node` decode the NODE_INFO block: one 8-word entry
per device, with its Modbus slave address, 64-bit serial and model code.
`DeviceReader.read_nodes()` reads it. Decoded against a real system:

| slave | model | device |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 3004 | EBOX - the settings controller that writes go to |
| 1 | 1004 | EP2000 inverter |
| 41 | 4001 | HV800 battery pack |

### Raw reads at other slaves

`DeviceReader.read_raw(address, count, slave=1)` can now read at another
slave address. It is still function 3 only. Choosing which slaves are
safe to ask is left to the caller; the integration only allows slaves that
appear in the node list.

## 2.0.3 (2026-10-04)

Adds `DeviceReader.read_raw(address, count)`: a one-off, read-only read of up
to 32 registers, for exploring addresses a device definition does not cover.
No change to polling or writes.

- **Read-only.** It only ever sends Modbus function 3, at the read slave.
- **Shares the polling lock and connection**, so it never interleaves with a
  poll or a write.
- **Refusal and silence are results, not exceptions.** It returns a
  `RawReadResult` whose `outcome` is `ok`, `refused` (with the Modbus
  exception code), `no_reply`, `not_connected` or `error`. Exploring means
  asking for addresses the device may not serve, and neither answer says
  anything is wrong with the link.
- `RawReadResult.as_dict()` gives each word unsigned, signed and in hex.
- Bounds are enforced: 1 to `MAX_RAW_READ_COUNT` (32) registers, within
  0-65535.

Used by bluetti-bt-connect 2.0.4's `read_registers` action.

## 2.0.2 (2026-10-04)

Adds two raw, read-only registers to the EP2000 to look for the battery pack
temperature, which nothing on this device has exposed so far. No other
behaviour changes.

### Why

A Modbus TCP read of an EP2000 (bluetti-community/bluetti-registers#42) shows
a pack average temperature, `b_t_avg` (51224), whose unit is in doubt - °C,
°C with an offset, or °F. Reading the same quantity over Bluetooth at the same
moment settles it. The BLUETTI app's register list points at two candidates:

| field | register | where |
|---|---|---|
| `raw_register_6007` | 6007 | pack main-info block (6000+) |
| `raw_register_6115` | 6115 | directly after pack SOH (6114) |

Both are reported **exactly as the device sends them** - no scaling, offset
or bounds - and named by address, because what they hold is not confirmed.

### How they are read safely

Neither address had been read on this device before. A device can answer an
address it does not serve with silence instead of an error, and a silent
register inside an ordinary read would time out and fail the whole poll. So
these use a new `ProbeUIntField`:

- **Never merged into grouped reads.** Each is read on its own, after
  everything else in the poll.
- **A refusal or a timeout only drops that register.** The rest of the poll is
  unaffected, and the register is not asked for again until the integration
  restarts - an unserved address costs one failed request, not one per poll.
- **A real connection failure still aborts the poll as before.**

Read-only: nothing is written to the device. Reads use slave 1, like every
other read.

## 2.0.1 (2026-09-29)

Maintenance release. **No code or behaviour changes** - the library is
identical to 2.0.0, so there is nothing to update in Home Assistant.

### Changes

- **PyPI project links now point to the new GitHub account**
  (`https://github.com/Ellmondo/bluetti-bt-connect-lib`). PyPI only reads
  links from a published release, so 2.0.0 kept showing the old username.
- **Release workflow updated to current GitHub Actions** (`checkout@v7`,
  `setup-python@v7`, `upload-artifact@v7`, `download-artifact@v8`), which run
  on Node.js 24 and clear the Node.js 20 deprecation warnings.
- **Runners pinned to `ubuntu-24.04`** instead of `ubuntu-latest`, so the
  build environment only changes when the workflow is deliberately updated.

## 2.0.0 (2026-09-21)

**Local write control of the Bluetti EP2000 (+ EBOX) works.** The long-standing
"a write is accepted and then silently reverts" problem is solved. Settings
written over local Bluetooth - grid import/export limits, working mode, the
switches - now persist. This is the headline of 2.0.

### TL;DR

- **The fix: writes go to Modbus slave 0, not slave 1.** On this 2nd-generation
  IoT device the inverter answers on slave 1, but the authoritative settings
  controller is on slave 0. A write to slave 1 was echoed by the inverter and
  then overwritten within a few seconds from the slave-0 setpoint. Writing to
  slave 0 makes it stick. Reads stay on slave 1 (they work and reflect slave-0
  writes after a few seconds).
- **New "EMS / AI Control Mode" switch** (register 2241). When on, Bluetti's AI
  actively manages the system and overrides manual settings; off = manual control.
- **Grid import entities now appear** - their read bounds were too low and were
  silently discarding the device's real values.
- **The v1.8.0 register-7 "unlock" experiment is removed** - it was a wrong turn
  (register 7 sets the Bluetooth password; it is not a session login).

### The story (why this took a while)

Writes into the EP2000's grid/mode registers came back with a clean, protocol-
valid acknowledgement and then didn't take effect. Earlier releases suspected a
cloud/MQTT commit step, a licensed BLE encryption handshake, or a "Pro Mode"
authentication gate, because that is the industry-wide pattern for grid-facing
settings. Several hypotheses were tested on real hardware and ruled out:

- **Register 7 "unlock"** (v1.8.0) - decompiling the app showed register 7 is the
  *set Bluetooth password* action from the settings screen, not a login. Writing
  to it did nothing for persistence. Removed.
- **EMS/AI control mode alone** - turning it off helped at slave 1 briefly but the
  value still reverted; not the root cause on its own.
- **A commit pulse** (`CTRL_EVENT` 2006, `CTRL_POWER_OUTPUT_STATE_SAVE` 2226) -
  the value still reverted after sending them.
- **A slow revert** - ruled in as a symptom; the value snapped back to an enforced
  setpoint within seconds.

The decisive test wrote the same register at **slave 0** and watched it: it held,
and read back correct at slave 0, propagating to the slave-1 reading after ~5s -
exactly the delay the official app shows before it opens its settings screen. The
app itself writes settings to `getSettingsSlaveAddr()`, which returns 0 for
2nd-generation IoT devices. Mystery solved: it was the slave address all along.

### Changes since 1.7.0

#### Fixed
- **Settings writes now target Modbus slave 0 on the EP2000** so they persist.
  Added a configurable `BluettiDevice.write_slave_addr` (default 1, so no other
  device changes behaviour), threaded through `DeviceRegister`,
  `WriteableRegister` and `WriteableRegisters`; EP2000 sets it to 0.
- **Max Grid Import Power / Current now read correctly.** Their bounds were capped
  at 6600 W / 40 A - values taken from an earlier, lower app setting - so the
  device's real values (8600 W / 45 A) were being discarded by range validation
  and the entities showed unavailable. Raised to 9600 W / 50 A.
- **Working Mode stays at register 2005** (corrected in 1.6/1.7 from the old 2013,
  which is the device power on/off control).

#### Added
- **`ValueSwitchField`** - a switch whose on/off states are arbitrary register
  values rather than 1/0.
- **EMS / AI Control Mode** field on the EP2000 (register 2241, on=8 / off=0),
  surfaced as a switch by the integration.
- **Standalone BLE diagnostics** at the repo root (`scan_addr.py`,
  `probe_slave.py`, `probe_grid.py`, `probe_writepath.py`, `probe_commit.py`) -
  raw-Modbus tools, no library import needed, used to find and confirm the fix.

#### Removed
- The register-7 "unlock" feature added in 1.8.0 (`unlock.py`, the DeviceReader
  hook and config field, and its test). It never authorised anything.

#### Verified register map (EP2000, against the app's `ProtocolAddrV2`)
`2005` working mode - `2213` grid import power (W) - `2214` grid import current (A)
- `2215` grid export power (W) - `2216` grid export current (A) - `2207` charge
from grid - `2208` grid export enable - `2241` EMS/AI control (8=on).

### Upgrading

`pip install -U bluetti-bt-connect-lib` (or let the companion Home Assistant
integration pull `==2.0.0`). After changing a setting, allow a few seconds for it
to settle before trusting the read-back. For manual control, keep AI Control Mode
**off**.
